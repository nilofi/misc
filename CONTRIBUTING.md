# Set up development environment 

Please make sure you have **Git**, **Node.js** (v20+), **PNPM** (v8+) installed on your device. 

We recommend using [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your code editor. This is not a rule, but it will get you into development faster, and the next part The content will be written on this basis. 

Clone the project and run in the project root directory: 

```shell 
pnpm install 
``` 

# Put into development
